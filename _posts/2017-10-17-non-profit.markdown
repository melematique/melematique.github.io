At 18, a social work class I was taking required 60 hours of community service with a # non-profit of our choice. I stumbled on the town's public housing community and by pure stroke of luck found what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. For three years while I attended university in that town, I volunteered with the public housing authority at their various resource centers, helping communities in need. I worked with both students and their parents, mentoring and tutoring and filling in all the gaps in between. I watched in admiration as the community looked towards the coordinator for help on all their problems, big or small. 

At 27, I finally got my own resource center and community. To say there's never enough hours in the day to help everyone would be an understatement. I've found that sometimes I have had to shorten my time with the community however to focus on paperwork and tracking, which can be tedious and time-consuming. My hope is to create more effective systems for non-profits, so that a coordinator's time is more devoted to the community in face to face interactions, instead of losing hours behind a computer screen. If I can create an efficient system used by companies, I'm helping create more hours devoted to positive interactions and creating change. 

The more people I can help, the better.
